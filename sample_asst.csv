THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO CONSTRUCT THE SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION FOR DOCUMENTING WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT IS NOT KNOWN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF WILDFIRES, CONSERVATION PRACTICES AND MANAGEMENT ACTIONS ON RANGELANDS WIND AND WATER EROSION PROCESSES. THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA AT RENO IS UNDERTAKING A COOPERATIVE PROJECT WITH THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE TO EVALUATE IF THE RANGELAND HYDROLOGY AND EROSION MODEL CAN SUCCESSFULLY QUANTIFY SOIL EROSION ON RANGELANDS. A SECOND ASPECT IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF ADDING COMPOST TO CALIFORNIA ANNUAL GRASSLANDS TO ENHANCE THE HEALTH OF THESE PLANT COMMUNITIES UNDER CHANGING CLIMATES. THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THE JOINT EFFORT IS TO ASSESS WIND EROSION ON AREAS RECENTLY BURNED BY WILDFIRE AND THE BENEFITS OF REVEGETATION IN REDUCING DUST FLUXES FROM DISTURBED RANGELANDS. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES ARE OFTEN POORLY UNDERSTOOD ON ANNUAL GRASSLANDS AND POORLY DOCUMENTED FOR POST FIRE SAGEBRUSH STEPPE PLANT COMMUNITIES IN ECOLOGICAL SITE DESCRIPTIONS. ACCURATE WIND AND WATER EROSION PREDICTIONS ON ANNUAL GRASSLANDS WITH THE ABILITY TO ESTIMATE HIGH RISK AREAS FOR EROSION WILL IMPROVE THE CONSERVATION PLANNING PROCESS AND ULTIMATELY, THE SUCCESS OF CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. THE PROJECT WILL DETERMINE IF THE ADDITION OF ORGANIC AMENDMENTS (COMPOST) CAN BE ADDED TO CALIFORNIA ANNUAL RANGELAND WITHOUT NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO WATER QUALITY OR HAVE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HYDROLOGIC FUNCTION OF THE ECOLOGICAL SITE. THE PROJECT WILL QUANTIFY DUST FLUXES PRE AND POST FIRE DISTURBANCE ON SAGEBRUSH PLANT COMMUNITIES IN THE GREAT BASIN IN ASSOCIATION WITH CONSERVATION/REVEGETATION PRACTICES. THE ARS AND UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA RENO WILL 1) EXPAND THE RHEM MODEL ANNUAL GRASSLANDS, 2) TEST IMPACTS ON SOIL SURFACE EROSION AND HYDROLOGIC FUNCTION OF COMPOST APPLIED TO RANGELANDS, 3) PROVIDE COURSE MATERIAL FOR ECO-HYDROLOGY TRAINING 4) INFORM THE HYDROLOGIC SECTIONS OF ECOLOGICAL SITE DESCRIPTIONS, AND 5) ESTABLISH DUST FLUX MONITORING STATIONS TO DOCUMENT BENEFITS OF REVEGETATION.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,,,C,REVISION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_5820600002_12H2/,2022-03-04 10:19:30.181503+00

AN EMERGING IMAGING PHENOTYPE OF TUMOR RECURRENCE INDICATES THAT A COMPLETE RADIOGRAPHIC RESPONSE MAY BE FOLLOWED BY VARIABLE PERIODS OF LATENCY WITHOUT PERCEPTIBLE GROWTH IN POORLY PERFUSED MICROENVIRONMENTS. THIS IMAGING PHENOTYPE HIGHLIGHTS THE CAPABILITY OF CANCER CELLS TO ADAPT THEIR GROWTH PROGRAM TO THEIR MICROENVIRONMENT AND EFFECT TUMOR DORMANCY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUNCTIONAL MEASURES OF THIS ALTERED TUMOR METABOLISM IS CRITICAL TO EFFECTIVE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL IMAGING OF RESPONSE. TRANS-ARTERIAL CHEMOEMBOLIZATION (TACE) FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC) PROVIDES A COMPELLING CLINICAL CORRELATE TO THIS IMAGING DEFICIENCY. TACE EXPLOITS THE VASCULAR BIOLOGY OF HCC TO DEPRIVE TUMORS OF NUTRIENTS, LEADING TO NECROSIS; HOWEVER, ONLY 44% OF LARGE TREATED LESIONS DEMONSTRATE EXTENSIVE NECROSIS ON PATHOLOGY, UNDERSCORING THE ADAPTIVE RESPONSE OF HCC CELLS TO NUTRIENT DEPRIVATION. THIS ADAPTIVE RESPONSE IS REFLECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF VIABLE TUMOR CELLS ADJACENT TO REGIONS OF NECROSIS ON HISTOPATHOLOGY, AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RAPID RECURRENCE FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF LATENCY THAT IS OFTEN DISCOVERED ON FOLLOW-UP IMAGING. THUS, TACE PROVIDES A USEFUL MODEL FOR IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISMS MOBILIZED BY CANCER CELLS TO SURVIVE SEVERE ISCHEMIA. IN PRELIMINARY STUDIES, WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT TACE-LIKE SEVERE ISCHEMIA INDUCES QUIESCENCE IN SURVIVING CELLS AND THAT THESE CELLS ACTIVATE A METABOLIC STRESS RESPONSE (MSR) INCLUDING HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTORS, THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE AND AUTOPHAGY, WHICH REPROGRAM METABOLISM TO ENABLE SURVIVAL UNDER ISCHEMIC CONDITIONS. THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF DYNAMIC HYPERPOLARIZED CARBON-13 NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTROSCOPIC IMAGING (DNP-13C-NMRS) HAS YIELDED PROMISING RESULTS IN STUDIES OF METABOLISM IN HEPATOCELLULAR DISEASE. THIS TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS A UNIQUE RESOURCE TO TRANSLATE ADVANCES IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MSR INTO A NON-INVASIVE, CLINICALLY APPLICABLE IMAGING PARADIGM TO IDENTIFY DORMANT CANCER CELLS SURVIVING ISCHEMIA. THE CONVENTIONAL POST-TACE IMAGING PHENOTYPE OF SUSTAINED SURVIVAL WITHOUT PROLIFERATION UNDER METABOLIC STRESS WILL BE EXAMINED USING TARGETED METABOLOMICS, PROTEOMIC AND EPIGENETIC PROFILING OF HCC CELLS TO DEVELOP A DNP-13C-NMRS BASED IMAGING APPROACH. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS APPLICATION ARE TO: A) CHARACTERIZE THE NUTRIENT MICROENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS THE EPIGENETIC AND PROTEOMIC ALTERATIONS UNDERLYING MSR-INDUCED METABOLIC ADAPTATION IN CELLS SURVIVING ISCHEMIC STRESS, B) DEVELOP A DNP- 13C-NMRS BASED METABOLIC IMAGING APPROACH TO ENABLE THE NON-INVASIVE DETECTION OF CELLS SURVIVING ISCHEMIC STRESS IN VITRO, AND C) TRANSLATE THIS APPROACH TO CHARACTERIZE CELLS SURVIVING TRANS-ARTERIAL EMBOLIZATION IN VIVO.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,,,B,CONTINUATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_DP5OD021391_7529/,2022-03-04 22:40:32.097582+00

HOWEVER, THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT SEMANTIC MEMORY (I.E., MEMORY FOR MEANING, GENERAL KNOWLEDGE, AND FACTUAL INFORMATION) ALSO DECLINES RELATIVELY EARLY IN THE AD PROCESS WHICH COMPELS US TO EXPLORE WHETHER SEMANTIC MEMORY MEASURES ARE SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC FOR IDENTIFYING AD RISK, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IN VIVO MEASURES OF AD PATHOLOGY, AND ARE POTENTIALLY USEFUL AS CLINICAL TRIAL OUTCOME MEASURES. BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY DATA, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SEMANTIC MEMORY WILL BE RELATED TO BOTH AMYLOID (PIB) AND TAU (T807/AV1451) DEPOSITION ON PET NEUROIMAGING. FURTHERMORE, WE EXPECT NOVEL MEASURES OF SEMANTIC MEMORY TO ADD SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY TO TRADITIONAL EPISODIC MEMORY MEASURES AND THUS PROVIDE A USEFUL COMPOSITE OUTCOME MEASURE IN SECONDARY PREVENTION TRIALS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL LEVERAGE THE RICH IMAGING AND CLINICAL DATASET AVAILABLE FROM THE NIA FUNDED HARVARD AGING BRAIN STUDY COHORT AND RELATED STUDIES, BUT WILL PROVIDE A UNIQUE AVENUE OF INVESTIGATION FOR THE CANDIDATE. THE CANDIDATE IS A CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST WHO SEEKS TRAINING IN COGNITIVE TEST DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION, MULTI-MODAL NEUROIMAGING, AND ADVANCED ANALYTIC METHODS, IN ORDER TO POSITION HER TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER. THE CANDIDATE'S CAREER DEVELOPMENT WILL BENEFIT FROM THE CLOSE MENTORSHIP AND SCIENTIFIC GUIDANCE OF WELL- ESTABLISHED INVESTIGATORS WITH EXPERTISE SPANNING MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL INFORM FUTURE SECONDARY PREVENTION TRIALS, IN WHICH SENSITIVE COGNITIVE INDICATORS OF EARLY AD WILL BE NECESSARY TO BETTER IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK SUBJECTS AND TRACK EARLY CLINICAL DECLINE AND RESPONSE TO TREATMENT.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,M,NONPROFIT WITH 501C3 IRS STATUS (OTHER THAN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION),,,B,CONTINUATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_K23AG053422_7529/,2022-03-04 22:40:32.097582+00

CURRENTLY NIH, CDC, GATES FOUNDATION, WELLCOME TRUST, BRITISH MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN & DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CLINICAL TRIALS PARTNERSHIP PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FOR TB AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES RESEARCH IN UGANDA, INCLUDING EVALUATION OF NEW DIAGNOSTICS; DRUG TREATMENT REGIMENS; AND VACCINES AND TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES OF PATHOGENESIS AND CORRELATES OF IMMUNITY. AS SUCH, MOST OF THE TRAINING IS IN CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND STUDY DESIGN AND NONE SPECIFICALLY TARGETS THE GAP IN LABORATORY-BASED RESEARCH SCIENTISTS THAT WILL BECOME FACULTY MEMBERS, COMPETITIVE FOR EXTRAMURALLY FUNDED RESEARCH PROGRAMS. BECAUSE OF IDENTIFIED GAPS IN TRAINING IN BASIC AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH ON TB AND EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES, BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER (BMC)/BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE (BUSM) SOUGHT OUT AND SECURED FUNDING FROM THE FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER TO FUND CAPACITY BUILDING IN THIS AREA. DURING THIS PERIOD, THREE UGANDAN SCIENTISTS RECEIVED TRAINING UNDER THE PROGRAM AND ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING FURTHER GRADUATE STUDIES. THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED COLLABORATIVE LINKS AND SOLIDIFIED A JOINT COMMITMENT TO CO-MENTORSHIP OF UGANDA TRAINEES BY BMC/BUSM AND MU. SHORT COURSES FUNDED UNDER THIS PROGRAM HAVE BECOME ESSENTIAL TO THE TRAINING REGIMEN OF MASTERS AND PHD STUDENTS AND HAVE PROVIDED A CONDUIT FOR DISCUSSION WITH FACULTY AND FURTHER RECRUITMENT. DESPITE THESE STRIDES, THERE IS STILL A PRESSING NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN BASIC AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH. FOR THIS RENEWAL APPLICATION, WE WILL MAKE TWO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. FIRST, WE WILL TARGET MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATES WHO INTEND TO ENROLL IN A PHD PROGRAM AT MU; TRAINEES WILL BE RECRUITED TO ONE OR TWO AREAS DESIGNATED AS CRITICAL FOR DEVELOPMENT BY THE MU FACULTY AND THE PROGRAM DIRECTORS AND SCIENTIFIC DIRECTORS. SECOND, RUTGERS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL (NJMS) HAS BEEN ADDED AS A SECOND SITE OF TRAINING. ITS ADDITION WILL PROVIDE EXPERTISE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF DRUG RESISTANCE AND BASIC AND TRANSLATIONAL IMMUNOLOGY. ABOVE ALL, OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE TO PROVIDE TRAINEES WITH A STRONG BACKGROUND IN BASIC RESEARCH SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THROUGH RIGOROUS TARGETED COURSEWORK COUPLED WITH INTENSIVE LABORATORY TRAINING IN A PARTICULAR RESEARCH AREA.

THESE PRESUMED SELFISH ""JUNK"" DNA SEQUENCES REPRESENT A POTENTIAL MUTAGENIC SOURCE ABLE TO WREAK HAVOC ON GENOME STABILITY AND INTEGRITY. WHILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESEARCH WORK HAS SHOWN THAT GERM CELLS EXPLOIT A GERMLINE SPECIFIC SMALL RNA SYSTEM, THE PIRNA PATHWAY, TO SILENCE TRANSPOSONS IN ANIMAL GONADS, WE KNOW SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ABOUT TRANSPOSON ACTIVITY AND THE MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL TRANSPOSONS IN SOMATIC TISSUES. IT HAS LONG BEEN ASSUMED THAT TRANSPOSONS BARELY MOVE IN SOMATIC CELLS. THIS CONCLUSION COULD LARGELY BE DUE TO THE INSENSITIVE TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO MEASURE TRANSPOSON MOBILIZATION. RECENTLY, INCREASING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT TRANSPOSITION OCCURS DURING NORMAL NEUROGENESIS AND EMBRYOGENESIS. OUR PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE COMPARABLE NUMBERS OF INSERTION EVENTS IN SOMATIC TISSUES AND OVARIES DURING FRUIT FLY DEVELOPMENT. INTERESTINGLY, IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THAT TRANSPOSONS BECOME HIGHLY ACTIVE IN AGED CELLS, FOLLOWING ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS OR DURING TUMORIGENESIS. THESE OBSERVATIONS RAISE THE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY THAT TRANSPOSONS CONTRIBUTE TO ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT, AGING AND DISEASE PROGRESSION. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, I WILL FIRST ESTABLISH A ROBUST PLATFORM TO CAPTURE SINGLE TRANSPOSITION EVENTS WITH SINGLE CELL RESOLUTION AND DETERMINE THEIR INSERTION SITES WITH BASE-PAIR RESOLUTION (AIM 1). BASED ON THE ENCOURAGING PRELIMINARY DATA WE HAVE, IN THE SECOND AIM, I WILL APPLY OUR PLATFORM TO STUDY TRANSPOSON ACTIVITIES IN ASTROCYTES AND EXPLORE POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF TRANSPOSONS IN THESE MOST ABUNDANT BRAIN CELLS. TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE TRANSPOSON CONTROL IN SOMATIC TISSUE, I WILL ALSO PERFORM A GENOME WIDE MUTAGENESIS SCREEN TO IDENTIFY THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO TAME TRANSPOSONS.
